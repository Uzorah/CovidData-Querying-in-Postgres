# Data Querying
A data set tracking COVID deaths, cases and vaccinations
## Getting Started
This dataset was downloaded from [Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), split into two to create `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations` tables
### Filtering
1. Cut the `populations` column in the dataset, column AS, and paste in column E. Delete everything from column AA to the end and save as `coviddeaths`.
2. Undo the delete in the original dataset and delete columns E-Z. Save as `covidvaccinations`.
Import both datasets into the RDBMs
